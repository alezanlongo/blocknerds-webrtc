            There are situations where determining where a provider "normally"
            practices is desired. Unfortuantely, there is no such concept in
            athenaNet since providers often practice in multiple locations.
            However, we can use some intelligence to determine this by looking
            back over the previous few months (90 days) to see actual practice.
            To enable this, set this value between 0 and 1; it is highly
            recommended to be at least .5. This is the ratio of appointments in
            a given department to the total number of appointments for that
            provider. A value of .5 means "the provider's appointments are 50%
            in the department guessed." Setting this to 1 would only return a
            department if ALL of the provider's appointments were in one
            department.
